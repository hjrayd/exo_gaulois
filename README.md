##What is it about? 
It's an exercise where i used mySQL for ther first time. It is based on a popular french comics called "Asterix and Obelix".
I had to do some queries first. Then, i had to make a PHP application based on this exercise, where we can see all of the residents and where they live.
When we click on one of the names, we can see which potions the resident drank, based on the database.
